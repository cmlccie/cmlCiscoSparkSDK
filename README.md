# cmlCiscoSparkSDK

**cmlCiscoSparkSDK has been deprecated; please use ciscosparkapi.**

I'm very happy and pleased with the benefit that this package provided many of you seeking a Python Spark API wrapper!  I took the things I learned creating this package, and the lessons learned from others wiser than myself, and authored the [CiscoDevNet\ciscosparkapi](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ciscosparkapi) project.

I have for sometime devoted my energies towards this effort to the new project, and it is now much more functional and API-complete when compared to this first effort.

Going forward, please use the [CiscoDevNet\ciscosparkapi](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ciscosparkapi) package.

I will not be making any further updates to this one.

_Thank you!_

Chris
